Soft Story Buildings
====================

Helping Oakland residents understand their buildings' earthquake risks

### One-liner
A simple way for people to view information on the status of "soft-story" buildings in Oakland.

### Status
- 2/11/14: Interested folks (myself [@daguar], @kleinlieu and @spjika) met with the Director of Planning and Building last Friday, and she agreed to get us the City's data on soft-story buildings. (City staff have also followed up saying they're working on the records request.)

### Data

The City has responded to my records request with data!!! See here:

### Description
The [Association of Bay Area Governments](http://quake.abag.ca.gov/projects/oakland-soft-story/) identified 1,379 "soft-story" buildings in Oakland that are the highest-risk for causing injuries or worse in a large earthquake. The City of Oakland then passed an ordinance requiring properties' owners submit a "screening" of these buildings with basic facts that can inform a risk assessment for each building. Among the biggest factors are slope and having parking/empty space underneath the building.

[ABAG's report](http://quake.abag.ca.gov/wp-content/documents/OaklandSoftStoryReport_061113.pdf) details the findings of the first stage of screenings, but there currently seems to be no raw data, and therefore no way for a resident to find out the status of their own building.

What I'm thinking is making an easy way for residents (particularly renters) to see the seismic risk of buildings in Oakland (per the screening data.) It would be great to increase awareness, as renters suffer the consequences of not-retrofitting a building, but may not know that they're at-risk. With the rental market in Oakland booming, many landlords are making higher profits than they have in the past, and so making it easier for renters to advocate for retrofitting of their own buildings is my ultimate aim. (Berkeley, SF, and Fremont have all passed measures *requiring* retrofits of soft-story buildings: with the prices and speculation in Oakland currently, the cost arguments should be less concerning over time.)

### Work to-date
I've contacted ABAG, requesting the data, but have not had any response. I've also submitted a public records request to the City of Oakland here: http://records.oaklandnet.com/request/2281

Stumbled upon the idea by way of this little app made for Berkeley:
